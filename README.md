# tetris-raylib

This is a project along my journey on learning graphics by using RayLib to build a variety of projects starting with a Pong clone and ending (if everything goes according to plan) with a Minecraft-like game (I couldn't have possibly picked a more saturated set of projects, not a bad choice in that it will help beginners like myself with more well-documented project).

I originally planned to start learning RayLib using this Tetris project, but then later figured I'd start with a simpler project, hence why I started with [Pong](https://github.com/AlOwain-LearningGraphics/pong-raylib).
